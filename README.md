Implementation of Grafana and Prometheus for System Monitoring
Objective
The objective of this project is to investigate, install, and configure Grafana and Prometheus to establish a robust monitoring system for a software application. The system will be tested using a Node.js service, and Docker along with Docker-Compose will be used for containerization. Git will manage version control and service configurations, which will be uploaded to a GitHub repository.

1. Preliminary Research
Research Activities
Explore Core Functionalities: Investigate the primary features and capabilities of Grafana and Prometheus.
Integration Strategies: Identify methods for integrating these tools with Node.js.
Review Use Cases: Examine similar projects and use cases to understand best practices and anticipate potential challenges.

3. Installing Docker and Docker-Compose
Installation Steps
Install Docker and Docker-Compose: Follow the official guides to install Docker and Docker-Compose on your development environment if not already installed:

Docker Installation Guide
Docker-Compose Installation Guide
Verification
Verify Installation: Ensure Docker and Docker-Compose are installed correctly by running the following commands:

docker --version
docker-compose --version

5. Configuring Prometheus
Docker-Compose Setup
Create Docker-Compose File: Define the Prometheus service in a docker-compose.yml file:

version: '3.7'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
      
Setting Up Metrics Collection
Prometheus Configuration: Create a prometheus.yml configuration file to specify the monitoring targets:

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node-app:3000']
      - 
4. Configuring Grafana
Docker-Compose Integration
Add Grafana Service: Extend the docker-compose.yml to include Grafana:

services:
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      
Setting Up Data Source
Configure Grafana:

Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000.
Log in using default credentials (admin / admin).
Add a new data source and select Prometheus.
Set the URL to http://prometheus:9090 and save.
Creating Dashboards
Dashboard Creation: Set up basic dashboards in Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.

5. Project Integration
Metrics Collection Implementation
Integrate Metrics Collection: Modify the project code to include metrics collection using appropriate libraries. For a Node.js application, libraries like prom-client can be utilized.
Ensuring Compatibility
Expose Metrics: Ensure metrics are exposed in a format compatible with Prometheus.

7. Version Control and GitHub Repository
Initialize Git
Set Up Git Repository: Initialize a local Git repository for the monitoring project:

git init
Add and Commit Project Files
Add Files to Repository:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Documentation
Create README.md: Document detailed instructions for the installation and configuration of the monitoring system.

8. Testing and Verification
Starting Services
Launch Services: Use Docker-Compose to start the Prometheus and Grafana services:

docker-compose up
Verification Process
Check Prometheus: Verify that Prometheus is collecting metrics.
Check Grafana: Ensure that Grafana is displaying the collected metrics correctly.
Adjustments
Refine Configuration: Make necessary adjustments to optimize the monitoring system.

8. Deliverables
GitHub Repository: Provide a repository with the Docker, Docker-Compose, Prometheus, and Grafana configurations.
Documentation: Include comprehensive documentation in the README.md file detailing the operation of the monitoring system.
Functional Dashboards: Ensure Grafana dashboards are functional and visualizing project metrics.
Code Modifications: Incorporate modifications in the project code to expose the necessary metrics for Prometheus.

10. Installation and Configuration Instructions
Prerequisites

Docker
Docker-Compose
Git

Steps to Install

Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

Run Docker-Compose:

docker-compose up

Access Grafana:
Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Verify Prometheus:
Ensure Prometheus is collecting metrics by navigating to http://localhost:9090.

Configuration Details
Prometheus Configuration: Located in prometheus.yml.
Docker-Compose File: Located in docker-compose.yml.
Grafana Dashboards: Basic dashboards are pre-configured, with the option to create additional dashboards as needed.
Testing and Verification
Metrics Collection: Confirm that metrics are being collected and displayed accurately in Grafana.
Adjustments: Make any necessary adjustments to ensure precise monitoring.
